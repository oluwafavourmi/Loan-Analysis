- We have a total of 480 loan applicants
- Average applicants income amounts to 5.36K
- Coapplicants Income in in the average value of 1.58K

- The total sum of loan given amounts to 69,000
- On an average we have a loan amount of 144.74 given to the applicants
- A comparison was made between the average salaries of those whose loans were approved and those whose loans weren't approved, our visualizations indicated that those with lesser average salaries were granted more loans
- The dataset has more of male applicants than female applicants with the total number of total male approved loan exceed 300, Female approved loan was less than 100
- Analysis was also done on the property area of the applicants, People in the Semiurban area have more loan approval - loan request denial ratio than anyother region, followed by the Urban area and lastly by thr Rural Area.
- Female applicants have close to 80% rejection rate.

Conclusion:
- From the dataset it is evidence that there is a high rate of loan requests approval, people with lesser income tend to get their loan approved, probably they're in need of it more.
- More loans should be given to the females so as to balance the shift of weight to the male applicants
- Irrespective of property location, chances are high of getting a loan, even higher when the property is located in the semiurban Area.
